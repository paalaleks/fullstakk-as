I was born in 1985 and am now 38 years old, single without my own family. As for my career, I have experience in construction work and railways. In 2021, I started a 2-year front-end development program at Noroff. Since then, I have devoted my time to building up my portfolio and gaining practical experience with kipara.no. I am now looking for my first professional job as a developer, and I hope that the person reading this is just the one to give me the opportunity.",
